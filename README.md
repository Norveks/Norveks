### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a new graduated electrical-electronics engineer who is more passionate about coding. During my internship and my study in university, I realised that electrical circuit does not fit with me and then I tried to put myself in this coding adventure. Yet I did not know about which area that I can myself rely on and so I found myself on data analysis. Coding everyday, every hour is not my thing. I need communication and getting up from the seat a little bit and may be that is why working with graphs and analitics sounds more like me. I mostly study on Python and SQL, there is still much to learn... as it always will be.

This repistory will be uploaded due to it is not finisned...
